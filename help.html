	<p>AIDS, short for <strong>aquired immune deficiency syndrome </strong> is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the HIV <strong>(Human immunodeficiency virus).</strong> The virus attacks cells that help the body fight infections, making the patient more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. There are multiple ways that these pesky little viruses can transmit from one person to another, you can learn more by clicking <a href="transmission.html">here</a>. Sadly, the human body can't naturally get rid of the HIV and we currently don't have a cure for it yet.
	<br>
	<br>
	AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the body's immune system is badly damaged because if the virus.
	<br>
		
	<br>
	In the United States, most people who have HIV doesn't develop aids because most patients took special "HIV medicine" that slows down the develompent of AIDS, Sadly those medicines are expensive and not readily available. Those medicines also isn't a guaranteed fix for AIDS
	<br>
	<br>
	A person with HIV is considered to have progressed to AIDS when:
	<br>
		<br>
	
	<li>the number of their CD4 cells falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood (200 cells/mm3). (In someone with a healthy immune system, CD4 counts are between 500 and 1,600 cells/mm3.) </li>
	<li>they develop one or more opportunistic infections regardless of their CD4 count.</li>
		<br>
		<br>
	Without HIV medicine, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years. Once someone has a dangerous opportunistic illness, life expectancy without treatment falls to about 1 year. HIV medicine can still help people at this stage of HIV infection, and it can even be lifesaving. But people who start ART soon after they get HIV experience more benefits—that’s why HIV testing is so important
