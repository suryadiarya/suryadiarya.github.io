		<h1><strong>There Are Multiple Ways HIV can Transmit</strong></h1>
		<p>The person-to-person spread of HIV is called HIV transmission. HIV is spread only in certain body fluids from a person who has HIV:
		<li>Blood</li><li>Semen</li><li>Rectal Fluids</li><li>Breast Milk</li><li>Pre-seminal Fluid</li></p>
		<p>HIV transmission is only possible if these fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or are directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe). Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, the vagina, the opening of the penis, and the mouth.</p>
		<p>HIV can also spread from a woman with HIV to her child during pregnancy, childbirth (also called labor and delivery), or breastfeeding. This is called mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</p>

		<p>In the past, some people were infected with HIV after receiving a blood transfusion or organ or tissue transplant from a donor with HIV. Today, this risk is very low because donated blood, organs, and tissues are carefully tested in the United States.</p>

		<p>You can't get HIV from casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. And you can't get HIV from contact with objects such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. </p></div>
