	<h1><strong>We Need Your Help</strong></h1>
	<p>Now more than ever, HIV charities need your support. These are the vital non-profit organizations that work tirelessly to advance HIV research, provide care and housing to those in need, and offer outreach and education to prevent the further spread of infection. This is no small feat given the scale of the epidemic, which claims around 16,000 lives and accounts for more than 35,000 new infections in the United States each year.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h1><strong>Why Donating Now Is Important?</strong></h1>
	<p>Despite efforts to turn back the tide of infections, we are nowhere near making the inroads needed to end the epidemic as we know it. With stagnating investment from donor nations and proposed cuts to PEPFAR (the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), we stand the very real possibility of losing many of the gains made in the past 15 years.
	<br><br>
	Even on the domestic front, we are faced with ever-increasing numbers of new infections in the South, dismal rates of viral suppression among those living with the disease, and one of the higher incidence rates of HIV of any country in the developed world.
	<br><br>
	In 2016 foundations, corporations, non-government organizations, and private donors have donated $680 million to domestic and international HIV programs, an $8 million increase over the previous high in 2008. Please check the schedule for the next donation schedule <a href="schedule.html">here.</a></p></div>
