	<h1><strong>Stages of HIV</strong></h1>
	<p>There are 3 stages of HIV and have different symptoms</p></div>
<div class="sym2"><h2><strong>Stage 1: Acute HIV Infection</strong></h2>
	<p></p>Within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV, about two-thirds of people will have a flu-like illness. This is the body’s natural response to HIV infection. 
	<br>
	Flu-like symptoms can include:<br>
	<li>Fever</li><li>Chills</li><li>Rash</li><li>Night Sweats</li><li>Muscle Aches</li><li>Sore Throat</li><li>Fatigues</li><li>Swollen Lymph Nodes</li><li>Mouth Ulchers</li></div>
<div class="sym3"><h2><strong>Stage 2: Clinical Latency</strong></h2>
	<p>In this stage, the virus still multiplies, but at very low levels. People in this stage may not feel sick or have any symptoms. This stage is also called chronic HIV infection.

Without HIV treatment, people can stay in this stage for 10 or 15 years, but some move through this stage faster.

If you take HIV treatment every day, exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load, you can protect your health and prevent transmission to others. But if your viral load is detectable, you can transmit HIV during this stage, even when you have no symptoms. It’s important to see your health care provider regularly to get your level checked.</p></div>
<div class="sym4"><h2><strong>Stage 3: AIDS</strong></h2>
	<p>f you have HIV and you are not on HIV treatment, eventually the virus will weaken your body’s immune system and you will progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). This is the late stage of HIV infection.
	<br>
	Symptoms of AIDS can include:
	<li>Rapid Weight Loss</li><li>Recurring fever or profuse night sweats</li><li>Extreme and unexplained tiredness</li><li>Prolonged swelling of the lymph glands in the armpits, groin, or neck</li><li>Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week</li><li>Red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids</li><li>Memory loss, depression, and other neurologic disorders</li></p>
	<h1><strong>If you have any of these symptoms please contact your doctor immediately!</strong></h1></div>
